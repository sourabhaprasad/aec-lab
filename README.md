## Car Price Prediction Using Random Forest Regressor
<p>
  In this experiment, a Random Forest Regressor model was trained on a car price prediction dataset using numerical features. The model achieved a commendable R2 score of [R2Score], indicating its effectiveness in accurately predicting car prices based on the provided input features.
</p>

## Exam Marks Prediction Using Linear Regression
<p>
  Investigate and clean a UCI dataset with 100 instances and 3 attributes, targeting student marks, study time, and courses. Build regression models, considering dataset limitations, and evaluate using metrics like R2 and RMSE, highlighting the challenge of accurate predictions with a small dataset while ensuring model applicability.
